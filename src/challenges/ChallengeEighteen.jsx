Instructions: 
Every time you change the input value, the factorial is calculated factorialOf(n) and 'factorialOf(n) called!' is logged to console.
On the other side, each time you click Re-render button, inc state value is updated. 
Updating inc state value triggers <CalculateFactorial /> re-rendering. 
But, as a secondary effect, during re-rendering the factorial is recalculated again â€” 'factorialOf(n) called!' is logged to console
See if there is any optimized way to fix it.
